## Languages

* French (native) \
Ayant grandi en région parisienne, le français est ma langue maternelle et celle avec laquelle j'ai étudié la majeure partie de ma scolarité.

* English (fluent - C1) \
I have fallen in love with the language of Shakespeare from a very young age. Since then I have surrounded myself with English speaking people and I now speak more English than French on a daily basis.

* Spanish (B1) \
Quasi toda mi familia es de origen Español y habla el idioma perfectamente. Entonces lo entiendo muy bien pero lo he perdido mucho y no lo hablo como ellos.
